# pSuCsTutor
This is the prototype app that is developed to help CS tutors ( where I am currently working ) help students easier. Students can make any appointment in advance and get help quickier.
This project made by me was supposed to implement quickly and easily for the purpose of POC ( Prove of Concept ). This project is using Firebase as back-end database.
